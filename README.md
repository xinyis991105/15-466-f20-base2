# Analogy Simulator 

Author: Xinyi Sun

Design: This game elucidates a subtle analogy between balloon and...something else.

How To Play:

Use WASD to control the movement of the balloon. Use mouse to adjust camera view (not necessarily helpful though). The floating balls are there to inflate the balloon so that it goes up higher. The goal is to reach the needle at the top.

Sources: Played around with Blender and created the assets myself...not beautiful but sufficiently useful :')

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
